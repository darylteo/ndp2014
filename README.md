# NDP 2014

## Purpose

Inspired by [this post](http://zitseng.com/archives/5743), we seek to make various improvements to the look, feel, and robustness of the National Day Parade 2014 website. This aims to be the up-to-date with current web trends, built rapidly to meet a June 2014 deadline, and to be a proud project of Singaporean citizens.

Also, because Singapore is "a nation thatâ€™s strong in ICT capabilities". (lol ~ *author*)
